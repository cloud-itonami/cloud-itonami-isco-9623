  "MeterReadingActor — the ISCO-08 9623 meter-reading-and-vending-
  machine-collection route scheduling/logistics coordination actor as
  a `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors
  section). One graph run = one route-coordination operation request
  (intake -> advise -> govern -> decide -> commit/hold, with a
  human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite
  internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can
  resume after human sign-off. Modeled closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-9611's wastecollect.actor for the outdoor
  route-based elementary-occupation hazard-domain shape, extended with
  a second, independent cash-handling trust/security hazard-scope
  dimension.

  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the Meter Reading and Vending-machine
  Collection Advisor can never directly commit an operating record the
  MeterReadingGovernor refuses, and can never make this actor finalize
  a cash-collection/reconciliation-execution decision (e.g. approving
  a specific cash pickup or reconciliation) or a site-safety-clearance
  decision (e.g. declaring a site cleared for entry), and can never
  override a route safety supervisor's judgment — every commit-record!
  call is gated behind `:decide`, and both scope-excluded decision
  classes are a permanent hard block regardless of disposition path.
  This actor coordinates ROUTE SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never
  enters a customer site, reads a meter or collects cash itself, and
  never makes a site-safety-clearance decision itself."
