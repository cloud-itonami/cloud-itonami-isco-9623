(ns meterread.governor
  "MeterReadingGovernor — the independent safety/scope layer gating
  every route scheduling/logistics proposal an advisor may make for a
  meter-reading-and-vending-machine-collection crew. The governor never
  dispatches hardware itself, never enters a customer site or reads a
  meter or collects cash itself, and never finalizes a cash-collection/
  reconciliation-execution decision (e.g. approving a specific cash
  pickup or reconciliation) or a site-safety-clearance decision (e.g.
  declaring a site cleared for entry), and never overrides a route
  safety supervisor's judgment — those are permanently out of this
  actor's scope and remain a route safety supervisor's exclusive
  judgment (README's 'Robotics premise': this actor coordinates ROUTE
  SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never enters a site, reads a meter or
  collects cash itself, and never makes a site-safety-clearance
  decision itself). Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-9611's
  wastecollect.governor for the outdoor route-based
  elementary-occupation hazard-domain shape, extended with a second,
  independent cash-handling trust/security hazard-scope dimension
  (meter readers and vending-machine collectors access customer sites
  — a site-access/personal-safety hazard from entering unfamiliar
  premises — and vending-machine collectors also handle cash from
  vending machines — a cash-handling trust/security hazard — so
  site-access/personal-safety-hazard and cash-handling-trust/security-
  hazard stakes stack independently, mirroring 9611's dual
  vehicle-traffic-hazard + hazardous-material-handling-hazard stack).

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. worker provenance     — the crew member must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    2. route provenance      — the meter-reading/vending-machine-
                                collection route must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    3. no-actuation           — proposal :effect must be :propose (the
                                governor never dispatches hardware and
                                never enters a site or collects cash
                                itself; it only gates what the advisor
                                may coordinate).
    4. closed op-allowlist    — only :log-work-record,
                                :schedule-crew-operation,
                                :flag-safety-concern and
                                :coordinate-supply-order may ever be
                                proposed; anything else is refused.
    5. scope-excluded action  — any proposal to directly finalize a
                                cash-collection/reconciliation-execution
                                decision (e.g. approving a specific cash
                                pickup or reconciliation), or to
                                directly finalize a site-safety-
                                clearance decision (e.g. declaring a
                                site cleared for entry), or to override
                                a route safety supervisor's judgment, is
                                a hard, permanent block (checked both
                                against the proposed :op and,
                                defense-in-depth, against the
                                proposal's :rationale text — matched as
                                full finalization/execution ACTION
                                phrases such as \"finalize the
                                cash-collection reconciliation\" /
                                \"declare the site safety cleared\" /
                                \"override the route safety
                                supervisor's judgment\", never as bare
                                nouns like \"meter\", \"cash\",
                                \"vending\", \"route\" or \"safety\", so
                                the check can never self-trip on the
                                advisor's own routine rationale text,
                                e.g. \"logged work record for worker …\"
                                or \"scheduled crew operation for
                                meter-reading and vending-machine
                                collection route task …\" or \"…routed
                                for route safety supervisor review\" —
                                all three legitimately contain those
                                bare nouns but none is a finalization
                                action, and all are exercised by
                                `governor-test/default-mock-advisor-proposals-never-self-trip-on-scope-exclusion`).
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off
  regardless of confidence):
    6. :op :flag-safety-concern (a site-access/personal-safety/
                                equipment-condition concern always

                                auto-commits).
